= Google+ Platform Hangout Video Selector App =

If you're reading this, you've probably taken a look at the Hangouts API
reference docs and want to get started creating your own hangout app. 

We suggest you get the Starter App up and running before you tackle
this one!  You can find it here:

https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/writing

== What's Included ==
This project provides:

 - videoSelector.xml
   The spec.

 - participantHighlight.png
   An image used as an avatar to highlight a given user.

== Using This Starter ==

Before you start modifying the provided code, it's a good idea to set up your 
hangout app. 

You need to host the .xml file somewhere publicly available, or use the link 
we provide in the docs.  Use the .xml as your gadget spec in the API console
at code.google.com.

We have hosted participantHighlight.png on our own appspot.com server for this 
demo.  Feel free to host this image anywhere you want!
